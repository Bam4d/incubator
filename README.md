# ENN Incubator
Collection of in-progress libraries for entity neural networks.

- [Entity Gym](entity_gym): Abstraction over reinforcement learning environments that represent observations as lists of structured objects.
- [ENN-PPO](ppo): PPO training loop for entity-gym environments. 
- [RogueNet](rogue_net): Ragged batch transformer implementation that accepts variable length lists of structured objects as inputs.
- [ENN-Zoo](enn_bench): Collection of entity_gym bindings for different environments.
- [ENN-BC](enn_bc): Supervised training loop on behavioral cloning datasets collected from entity-gym policies.
